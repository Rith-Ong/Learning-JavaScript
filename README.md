This repository contains a collection of projects I have worked on while learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each project showcases various concepts and techniques I’ve learned through tutorials and hands-on practice. This journey represents my progress in mastering web development, including building interactive websites, improving design skills, and gaining a deeper understanding of front-end technologies.
What’s Inside:

HTML: Basic structure and layout of web pages.

CSS: Styling and responsive design principles to make websites look polished and user-friendly.

JavaScript: Interactive elements, DOM manipulation, event handling, and adding functionality to web pages.

The goal of this repository is to track my growth, demonstrate my learning process, and create a reference for future projects.
